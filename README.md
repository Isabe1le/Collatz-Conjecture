# Collatz Conjecture - Python

> *The **Collatz conjecture** is a [conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture) in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") that concerns [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") defined as follows: start with any [positive integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_integer "Positive integer")  $n$. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is [even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(mathematics) "Parity (mathematics)"), the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.* [**Read more**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)


*Long story short, I got bored and decided to program a random maths thing.*
